# Girls Who Code 2022
Three web projects I built during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in 2022. This was my first formal introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript and putting these skills into practice.

1. An 'activist website' to spread awareness about a global issue - I chose electric vehicles (EVs)
2. A personal website
3. A BuzzFeed-style 'personality quiz' - I chose summer vs winter
