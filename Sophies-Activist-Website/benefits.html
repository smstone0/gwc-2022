        <h1>Reduction in both air and noise pollution</h1>
        <p>Unlike petrol vehicles, EVs do not emit any exhaust gases, resulting in cleaner air quality. Because they do not have engines, EVs are significantly quieter than petrol cars, which could help to improve sleep quality for people living in busy areas with lots of passing traffic. A reduction in air pollution will particularly benefit people living in towns and cities, as long-term exposure to air pollution can cause many health conditions, such as lung cancer. Recent research has associated air pollution with dementia and developmental problems. Furthermore, it is estimated by GOV.UK that <a class=links href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#why-we-focus-on-the-health-effects-of-air-pollution-in-your-professional-practice">roughly 28,000-36,000 people die in the UK as a result of air pollution each year. </a> </p>
